  # Send JoinQueue Message

  **Client → Server**

  This message is sent by the client to request joining the matchmaking queue.

  **Note**: This request in Bruno is just for documenting the payload. To actually send this message, you need to:
  1.  Open the `Connect to Matchmaking` request.
  2.  Click "Connect" to establish the WebSocket connection.
  3.  Once connected, go to the "Send Messages" tab in Bruno's WebSocket interface.
  4.  Paste the following JSON into the message input field and click "Send":

      ```json
      {
        "type": "JoinQueue"
      }
      ```
}
