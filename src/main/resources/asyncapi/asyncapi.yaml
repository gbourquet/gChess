  title: gChess WebSocket API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Real-time WebSocket API for gChess chess application.

    Provides real-time communication for:
    - Matchmaking (instant match notifications)
    - Gameplay (move execution, game state sync)
    - Spectators (observe games in real-time)

    **Authentication**: All WebSocket connections require JWT authentication.
    The JWT token must be provided either as a query parameter (?token=...)
    or in the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header.

    **Architecture**:
    - Matchmaking: Indexed by UserId (permanent user identity)
    - Gameplay: Indexed by PlayerId (per-game participation)
    - Spectators: Indexed by UserId (observers, not participants)
    - Authentication: Managed by WebSocketJwtAuth (shared kernel) across all contexts
